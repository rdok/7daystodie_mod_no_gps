> Replicates the experience of using a **paper map** from the pre-GPS era. This mod hides the player icon, name, map centering, header toolbar, drones, vehicles, and stats bar, engaging your brain for thoughtful exploration. By relying on memory and landmarks instead of quest markers, it encourages deeper engagement with the world, resulting in a more enjoyable and immersive experience.  
> **EAC:** This mod uses custom code that is not compatible with Easy Anti-Cheat.
